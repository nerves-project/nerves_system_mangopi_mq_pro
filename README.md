# MangoPi MQ Pro Support

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/fhunleth/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/fhunleth/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro)
[![Hex version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro.svg "Hex version")](https://hex.pm/packages/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro)

This is the base Nerves System configuration for the [MangoPi MQ Pro](#mangopi).

*This is a work in progress. It may change in backwards incompatible ways and the documentation might be lacking.*

To do:

- [x] Bring up WiFi
- [x] Verify Blue PWM LED
- [?] Fix MicroSD flakiness on boot (seems much better now?)
- [x] Verify USB host-only port (works with USB Flash drive)
- [x] Fix USB gadget mode on OTG port
- [x] Verify SPI (spidev1.0 and spidev1.1)
- [x] Verify I2C
- [ ] Verify all GPIO work (GPIO inputs seem to work)
- [x] Verify HW watchdog
- [x] Check that `TARGET_GCC_FLAGS` are right
- [x] Update Linux kernel to 5.18
- [x] Implement A/B firmware updates work
- [x] Use SID for serial number
- [ ] Reduce prints and shorten boot time
- [ ] Verify HDMI
- [ ] Verify camera

## Using

The most common way of using this Nerves System is create a project with `mix
nerves.new` and add `mangopi_mq_pro` references where needed and in a similar way
to the default systems like `bbb`, etc. Then export `MIX_TARGET=mangopi_mq_pro`.
See the [Getting started
guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html#creating-a-new-nerves-app)
for more information.

If you need custom modifications to this system for your device, clone this
repository and update as described in [Making custom
systems](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html).

## Example use

This example assumes some familiarity with Nerves. To use this system, you'll
need OTP 25. Follow the [Nerves installation
instructions](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/blob/main/docs/Installation.md)
for additional system dependencies.

Creating a new hello world application:

```sh
mix nerves.new hello_mango
cd hello_mango
```

Open up your `mix.exs` and add `:mangopi_mq_pro` to the `@all_targets` list at
the top. It's ok to delete targets that you don't plan on using.

Then add the `:nerves_system_mango_mq_pro` dependency to the `deps` function:

```elixir
    {:nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro, "~> 0.1", runtime: false, targets: :mangopi_mq_pro},
```

This will load the latest released version. To use the latest code on the `main`
branch here, add the following line:

```elixir
    {:nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro, runtime: false, targets: :mangopi_mq_pro, nerves: [compile: true], git: "https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro", branch: "main"}
```

To build and write to a MicroSD card, run:

```sh
export MIX_TARGET=mangopi_mq_pro
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix burn
```

## Console access

The console is configured to output to the UART on pins 8 and 10 on the 40-pin
GPIO connector. This is just like the Raspberry Pi. A 3.3V FTDI cable is needed
to access the output.

## Networking

The board has two network interfaces, a WiFi module and a virtual Ethernet on
the USB C connector marked "OTG". If virtual Ethernet isn't working for you, try
a different USB cable. You're welcome.

## GPIO

The following table is a mapping between the logical GPIO numbers used in
software (sysfs, Circuits.GPIO), and the pin numbers on the 20x2 Raspberry Pi
header. For example, to control pin 11 you would open a connection to GPIO 117:

```elixir
{:ok, pin} = Circuits.GPIO.open(117, :output)
```

| GPIO | Pin | Pin | GPIO |
| :--: | :-: | :-: | :--: |
|      | 1   | 2   |      |
| 205  | 3   | 4   |      |
| 204  | 5   | 6   |      |
| 39   | 7   | 8   | 40   |
|      | 9   | 10  | 41   |
| 117  | 11  | 12  | 37   |
| 118  | 13  | 14  |      |
| 32   | 15  | 16  | 33   |
|      | 17  | 18  | 110  |
|      | 19  | 20  |      |
|      | 21  | 22  | 65   |
|      | 23  | 24  |      |
|      | 25  | 26  | 111  |
| 145  | 27  | 28  | 144  |
| 42   | 29  | 30  |      |
| 43   | 31  | 32  | 64   |
| 44   | 33  | 34  |      |
| 38   | 35  | 36  | 34   |
| 113  | 37  | 38  | 35   |
|      | 39  | 40  | 36   |
