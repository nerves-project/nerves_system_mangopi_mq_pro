This is the base Nerves System configuration for the [MangoPi MQ Pro](#mangopi).

*The MangoPi MQ Pro works well, but there are active updates upstream and here. Backwards incompatible changes may be out of our control.*

## Using

The most common way of using this Nerves System is create a project with `mix
nerves.new` and add `mangopi_mq_pro` references where needed and in a similar way
to the default systems like `bbb`, etc. Then export `MIX_TARGET=mangopi_mq_pro`.
See the [Getting started
guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html#creating-a-new-nerves-app)
for more information.

If you need custom modifications to this system for your device, clone this
repository and update as described in [Making custom
systems](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html).

## Example use

This example assumes some familiarity with Nerves. To use this system, you'll
need OTP 25. Follow the [Nerves installation
instructions](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/blob/main/docs/Installation.md)
for additional system dependencies.

Creating a new hello world application:

```sh
mix nerves.new hello_mango
cd hello_mango
```

Open up your `mix.exs` and add `:mangopi_mq_pro` to the `@all_targets` list at
the top. It's ok to delete targets that you don't plan on using.

Then add the `:nerves_system_mango_mq_pro` dependency to the `deps` function:

```elixir
    {:nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro, "~> 0.1", runtime: false, targets: :mangopi_mq_pro},
```

This will load the latest released version. To use the latest code on the `main`
branch here, add the following line:

```elixir
    {:nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro, runtime: false, targets: :mangopi_mq_pro, nerves: [compile: true], git: "https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro", branch: "main"}
```

To build and write to a MicroSD card, run:

```sh
export MIX_TARGET=mangopi_mq_pro
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix burn
```

## Console access

The console is configured to output to the UART on pins 8 and 10 on the 40-pin
GPIO connector. This is just like the Raspberry Pi. A 3.3V FTDI cable is needed
to access the output.

## Networking

The board has two network interfaces, a WiFi module and a virtual Ethernet on
the USB C connector marked "OTG". If virtual Ethernet isn't working for you, try
a different USB cable. You're welcome.

## GPIO

The following table is a mapping between the logical GPIO numbers used in
software (sysfs, Circuits.GPIO), and the pin numbers on the 20x2 Raspberry Pi
header. For example, to control pin 11 you would open a connection to GPIO 117.

```elixir
{:ok, pin} = Circuits.GPIO.open(117, :output)
```

|      | GND  | 39  | 40  | I2S_D0   | 36   |

You can also get the pinout at the IEx prompt by using the
[pinout](https://hex.pm/packages/pinout) library.
