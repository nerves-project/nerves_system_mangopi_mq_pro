+	 *    go low 2s after the transaction (matches runtime PM timer). I couldn't get
+	 *    CS1 (PD15) to work.
+	 * 2. CS0 (PD10) and CS1 (PD15) are configured as GPIO outputs. DBI-DCX(PD14) was
+	 *    removed from pinctrl and is available for other uses now.
+	 * 3. The use of "rohm,dh2228fv" for the spidev devices is just used to get the
+	 *    usermode access.
